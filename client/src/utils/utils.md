The final new folder is the utils folder. This folder is for storing all utility functions such as formatters. This is a pretty straightforward folder and all the files in this folder should likewise be straightforward. I generally like to only store pure functions in this folder since if a utility function has side effects then it is most likely not just a simple utility function. Obviously there are exceptions to this rule, though.
