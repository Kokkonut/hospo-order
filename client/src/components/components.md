Another big change you will notice with this example is that our components folder is further broken down into subfolders. These subfolders are really useful since they help keep your components organized into different sections instead of just being one massive blob of components. In our example we have a ui folder which contains all our UI components like buttons, modals, cards, etc. We also have a form folder for form specific controls like checkboxes, inputs, date pickers, etc.

You can customize and breakdown this components folder however you see fit based on your project needs, but ideally this folder shouldn't get too large as many of your more complex components will be stored in the pages folder
